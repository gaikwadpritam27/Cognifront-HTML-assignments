        Why is Nasik important?
        Nashik has a rich historical past, as the mythology has it that Lord Rama, the King of Ayodhya, made Nashik his abode during his 14 years in exile. At the same place Lord Laxman, by the wish of Lord Rama, cut the nose of “Shurpnakha” and thus this city was named as “Nashik”.The Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple is located in Trimbak, one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, where a set of Hindu genealogy registers at Trimbakeshwar are maintained. The origin of the sacred Godavari river is at Brahmagiri peak near Trimbak.<br>
